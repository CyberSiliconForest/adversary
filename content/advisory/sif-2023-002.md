## Possible mitigation
### Proper mitigation
[Apply the patch](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/65c5626b65ee00d2663ec3604140a18427b65cdc)

### Partial mitigation
Configure the reverse proxy to explicitly filter out the requests with a
non-matching `HOST` header. Since most ActivityPub implementation which
uses HTTP message signature to authenticate server-to-server federation
includes `HOST` in their signature, it will provide a not-perfect-but-practical
defense against this attack.

Also, use a firewall to block external requests bypassing the reverse
proxy.
