## Description
Misskey's missing signature validation allows arbitrary users to impersonate any remote user.

## Affected software/version
* [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey) version below `2023.11.1-beta.1`
* [Firefish](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish) version below `1.0.5-rc`
* [CherryPick](https://github.com/kokonect-link/cherrypick) version below `4.5.1`

## Severity
CVSS v4.0 score: 7.1 (High)

Vector String: CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:P/VC:L/VI:H/VA:N/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N

CVSS v3.1 score: 9.3 (Critical)

Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N

## Detailed information
When Misskey has to verify the remote actor is eligible to `POST` into
the `inbox`, it only validates its HTTP message signature.

Due to lack of the header validation such as `Digest` and `Host`, it allows
attackers can spoof arbitrary users using ActivityPub server-to-server federation
protocol.

## Proof-of-Concept code
Will be released after 2023-12-14

## Possible mitigation
### Proper mitigation
Update

* Misskey to [2023.11.1](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/releases/tag/2023.11.1) or newer
* Firefish to [1.0.5-rc](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish/-/tags/v1.0.5-rc) or newer
* Cherrypick to [4.5.1](https://github.com/kokonect-link/cherrypick/releases/tag/4.5.1) or newer

If that is not a viable option,

For Misskey and CherryPick,

[Apply the patch](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/65c5626b65ee00d2663ec3604140a18427b65cdc)

Also, there is an amendment patch to address non-utf8 POST payloads.
[Apply this patch too](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/04075ee0bede198452dcd5e8ca6a00a3b750208b).

For Firefish,

[Apply the patch](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish/-/commit/3272b908c63b24f056d01c180e546f124009a6d1)

Hint: appending `.patch` at the end of the GitHub commit lets you download
the patch file. It can be applied using `git am` command.

### Partial mitigation
Configure the reverse proxy to explicitly filter out the requests with a
non-matching `HOST` header. Since most ActivityPub implementation which
uses HTTP message signature to authenticate server-to-server federation
includes `HOST` in their signature, it will provide a not-perfect-but-practical
defense against this attack.

Also, use a firewall to block external requests bypassing the reverse
proxy.
