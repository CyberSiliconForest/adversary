## Possible mitigation
### Proper mitigation
Update

* Misskey to [2023.11.1](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/releases/tag/2023.11.1) or newer
* Firefish to [1.0.5-rc](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish/-/tags/v1.0.5-rc) or newer
* Cherrypick to [4.5.1](https://github.com/kokonect-link/cherrypick/releases/tag/4.5.1) or newer

If that is not a viable option,

For Misskey and CherryPick,

[Apply the patch](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/65c5626b65ee00d2663ec3604140a18427b65cdc)

Also, there is an amendment patch to address non-utf8 POST payloads.
[Apply this patch too](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey/commit/04075ee0bede198452dcd5e8ca6a00a3b750208b).

For Firefish,

[Apply the patch](https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish/-/commit/3272b908c63b24f056d01c180e546f124009a6d1)

Hint: appending `.patch` at the end of the GitHub commit lets you download
the patch file. It can be applied using `git am` command.

### Partial mitigation
Configure the reverse proxy to explicitly filter out the requests with a
non-matching `HOST` header. Since most ActivityPub implementation which
uses HTTP message signature to authenticate server-to-server federation
includes `HOST` in their signature, it will provide a not-perfect-but-practical
defense against this attack.

Also, use a firewall to block external requests bypassing the reverse
proxy.
